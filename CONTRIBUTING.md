# Contributing to thynkai-docs

Docs are part of the protocol surface: clarity matters.

## Principles

- Prefer concrete definitions over slogans.
- Avoid hype. Write for engineers.
- Use stable terms and define them once.
- Keep changes small and reviewable.

## Workflow

```bash
npm ci
npm run ci
```

## Review process

Maintainers review for:
- correctness and consistency with other repos
- clear structure and minimal ambiguity
- tone: calm, confident, protocol-level
