# Principles

## 1) Protocol over platform
We publish stable interfaces and contracts first. Tools and implementations can evolve.

## 2) Evidence over claims
Performance claims must point to benchmarks, versions, dates, and artifacts.

## 3) Explainability over opacity
Scoring should produce a report with per-validator detail and diagnostics.

## 4) Safety by default
Tooling should avoid destructive defaults and treat inputs as untrusted.

## 5) Community-first, maintainer-led decisions
Open discussion is encouraged. Final decisions are accountable and documented.

## 6) Long-term maintainability
Prefer minimal dependencies, simple data formats, and predictable versioning.
