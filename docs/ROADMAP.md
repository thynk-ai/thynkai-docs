# Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally conservative: it prioritizes stability and usability over novelty.

## Now (0.x)
- Solidify core types and invariants
- Improve registry validation and templates
- Establish validator onboarding contract and fixture suite
- Provide scoring v1 with explainable reports

## Next (1.0 candidate)
- Protocol versioning policy across repos
- Schema versioning for registry entries
- Reliability weighting based on validator historical performance (opt-in)
- Benchmark registry improvements and metadata standardization

## Later
- Multi-benchmark aggregation profiles
- Attack-resistant scoring mechanisms
- Reference validator implementations for common benchmarks

## What we will not do
- Host model weights in the registry
- Replace existing ML ecosystems
- Hide governance decisions behind informal processes
