# Governance preview

ThynkAI is community-first, but it needs stable decision-making.

## What governance covers
- protocol-breaking changes
- scoring semantics
- validator onboarding requirements
- registry schema changes
- security-related decisions

## Proposals
A proposal is a structured document (issue or PR) that includes:
- summary
- rationale
- specification (what changes)
- compatibility impact
- security considerations
- test plan

## Decision rule
Maintainers accept proposals that improve:
- correctness and auditability
- backwards compatibility (or provide clear migration)
- security posture
- clarity for implementers

Accepted changes should be reflected in:
- tests
- docs
- changelogs (where applicable)
